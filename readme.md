## What is B.A.S.H?
It's an independent study (special topic) about information security with advisor Prof. Yeali S. Sun.

This project aims to display our researchs of malware profiling and tracelog anaylsis. We collect information of different malware families from diiferent websites, and provides summaries of different symptoms and technical descriptions. 

You can see the tracelog anaylsis through the [TRACELOG](https://cryolitez.github.io/BASH/index.html?name=Allaple) tab. We group different system calls of malwares into different stages, and provide brief information about its behavior. Some important behavior will be highlighted automatically.

Moreover, the website provides information about different dll files that involves with the malware.
