## What is B.A.S.H?
It's an independent study (special topic) about information security with advisor Prof. Yeali S. Sun.

This project aims to display our researches of malware profiling and tracelog analysis. We collect information of different malware families from different websites, and provides summaries of different symptoms and technical descriptions. 

You can see the tracelog analysis through the [TRACELOG](https://cryolitez.github.io/BASH/index.html?name=Allaple) tab. We group different system calls of malware into different stages, and provide brief information about its behavior. Some important behavior will be highlighted automatically.

Moreover, the website provides information about different dll files that involves with the malware.
