The attackers may include links to the malware in the emails, embed the malware into attached files, or place the malware in attached password-protected archives. The malware usually disguises itself using the icon of a legitimate file, such as Adobe Acrobat or Reader.\n\nWhen the Trojan is executed, it drops a copy of itself under the following file name:\n%UserProfile%\\Local Settings\\Temp\\[RANDOM FILE NAME ONE].exe\n\nThe Trojan serves as an initial infection vector for other threats. It downloads potentially malicious files from arbitrary URLs, such as the following:\ngidleybuilders.com/img/tp5.exe\ncushinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/rhc.exe\nadamdevarney.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/dt8.exe\n\nThe Trojan saves downloaded files under the following file name:\n%UserProfile%\\Local Settings\\Temp\\[RANDOM FILE NAME TWO].exe\n\nThe Trojan has been observed downloading the following malware, among others:\nTrojan.Cidox\nInfostealer.Dyranges\nTrojan.Asprox\nTrojan.Zbot\n\nFurther information\nMalicious links: Spammers change malware delivery tactics\nRecommendations\nSymantec Security Response encourages all users and administrators to adhere to the following basic security \"best practices\":\nUse a firewall to block all incoming connections from the Internet to services that should not be publicly available. By default, you should deny all incoming connections and only allow services you explicitly want to offer to the outside world.\nEnforce a password policy. Complex passwords make it difficult to crack password files on compromised computers. This helps to prevent or limit damage when a computer is compromised.\nEnsure that programs and users of the computer use the lowest level of privileges necessary to complete a task. When prompted for a root or UAC password, ensure that the program asking for administration-level access is a legitimate application.\nDisable AutoPlay to prevent the automatic launching of executable files on network and removable drives, and disconnect the drives when not required. If write access is not required, enable read-only mode if the option is available.\nTurn off file sharing if not needed. If file sharing is required, use ACLs and password protection to limit access. Disable anonymous access to shared folders. Grant access only to user accounts with strong passwords to folders that must be shared.\nTurn off and remove unnecessary services. By default, many operating systems install auxiliary services that are not critical. These services are avenues of attack. If they are removed, threats have less avenues of attack.\nIf a threat exploits one or more network services, disable, or block access to, those services until a patch is applied.\nAlways keep your patch levels up-to-date, especially on computers that host public services and are accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services.\nConfigure your email server to block or remove email that contains file attachments that are commonly used to spread threats, such as .vbs, .bat, .exe, .pif and .scr files.\nIsolate compromised computers quickly to prevent threats from spreading further. Perform a forensic analysis and restore the computers using trusted media.\nTrain employees not to open attachments unless they are expecting them. Also, do not execute software that is downloaded from the Internet unless it has been scanned for viruses. Simply visiting a compromised Web site can cause infection if certain browser vulnerabilities are not patched.\nIf Bluetooth is not required for mobile devices, it should be turned off. If you require its use, ensure that the device's visibility is set to \"Hidden\" so that it cannot be scanned by other Bluetooth devices. If device pairing must be used, ensure that all devices are set to \"Unauthorized\", requiring authorization for each connection request. Do not accept applications that are unsigned or sent from unknown sources.\nFor further information on the terms used in this document, please refer to the Security Response glossary.\n",
