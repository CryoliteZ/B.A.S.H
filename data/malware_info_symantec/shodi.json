Disabling System Restore (Windows Me/XP)\nIf you are running Windows Me or Windows XP, we recommend that you temporarily turn off System Restore. Windows Me/XP uses this feature, which is enabled by default, to restore the files on your computer in case they become damaged. If a virus, worm, or Trojan infects a computer, System Restore may back up the virus, worm, or Trojan on the computer.\n\nWindows prevents outside programs, including antivirus programs, from modifying System Restore. Therefore, antivirus programs or tools cannot remove threats in the System Restore folder. As a result, System Restore has the potential of restoring an infected file on your computer, even after you have cleaned the infected files from all the other locations.\n\nAlso, a virus scan may detect a threat in the System Restore folder even though you have removed the threat.\n\nFor instructions on how to turn off System Restore, read your Windows documentation, or one of the following articles:\n\"How to disable or enable Windows Me System Restore\"\n\"How to turn off or turn on Windows XP System Restore\"\nNote: When you are completely finished with the removal procedure and are satisfied that the threat has been removed, re-enable System Restore by following the instructions in the aforementioned documents.\n\nFor additional information, and an alternative to disabling Windows Me System Restore, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, \"Antivirus Tools Cannot Clean Infected Files in the _Restore Folder,\" Article ID: Q263455.\n2. Updating the virus definitions\nSymantec Security Response fully tests all the virus definitions for quality assurance before they are posted to our servers. There are two ways to obtain the most recent virus definitions:\nRunning LiveUpdate, which is the easiest way to obtain virus definitions: These virus definitions are posted to the LiveUpdate servers once each week (usually on Wednesdays), unless there is a major virus outbreak. To determine whether definitions for this threat are available by LiveUpdate, refer to the Virus Definitions (LiveUpdate).\nDownloading the definitions using the Intelligent Updater: The Intelligent Updater virus definitions are posted on U.S. business days (Monday through Friday). You should download the definitions from the Symantec Security Response Web site and manually install them.

Scanning for and repairing the infected files\nStart your Symantec antivirus software and make sure that it is configured to scan all the files.\nFor Norton AntiVirus consumer products: Read the document, \"How to configure Norton AntiVirus to scan all files.\"\nFor Symantec AntiVirus Enterprise products: Read the document, \"How to verify that a Symantec corporate antivirus product is set to scan all files.\"\nRun a full system scan.\nIf any files are detected as infected with W32.HLLP.Shodi, click Repair.\n\n\n\n"

            "symptoms": "Discovered:\nApril 20, 2004\nUpdated:\nFebruary 13, 2007 12:21:40 PM\nType:\nVirus\nSystems Affected:\nWindows\n\nThe following instructions pertain to all current and recent Symantec antivirus products, including the Symantec AntiVirus and Norton AntiVirus product lines.\nDisable System Restore (Windows Me/XP).\nRe-install your Symantec antivirus program.\nUpdate the virus definitions.\nRun a full system scan and repair all the files detected as W32.HLLP.Shodi.B.\nDelete the values that were added to the registry.\n\nFor specific details on each of these steps, read the following instructions.\n\n1. To disable System Restore (Windows Me/XP)\nIf you are running Windows Me or Windows XP, we recommend that you temporarily turn off System Restore. Windows Me/XP uses this feature, which is enabled by default, to restore the files on your computer in case they become damaged. If a virus, worm, or Trojan infects a computer, System Restore may back up the virus, worm, or Trojan on the computer.\n\nWindows prevents outside programs, including antivirus programs, from modifying System Restore. Therefore, antivirus programs or tools cannot remove threats in the System Restore folder. As a result, System Restore has the potential of restoring an infected file on your computer, even after you have cleaned the infected files from all the other locations.\n\nAlso, a virus scan may detect a threat in the System Restore folder even though you have removed the threat.\n\nFor instructions on how to turn off System Restore, read your Windows documentation, or one of the following articles:\n\"How to disable or enable Windows Me System Restore\"\n\"How to turn off or turn on Windows XP System Restore\"\nNote: When you are completely finished with the removal procedure and are satisfied that the threat has been removed, re-enable System Restore by following the instructions in the aforementioned documents.\n\nFor additional information, and an alternative to disabling Windows Me System Restore, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, \"Antivirus Tools Cannot Clean Infected Files in the _Restore Folder,\" Article ID: Q263455.\n\n2. To reinstall your Symantec antivirus program\nAs this virus attempts to remove the files and registry keys that your Symantec antivirus program uses, you may need to re-install the program. If your Symantec antivirus program is not properly working, uninstall, and then re-install it.\n\n3. To update the virus definitions\nSymantec Security Response fully tests all the virus definitions for quality assurance before they are posted to our servers. There are two ways to obtain the most recent virus definitions:\nRunning LiveUpdate, which is the easiest way to obtain virus definitions: These virus definitions are posted to the LiveUpdate servers once each week (usually on Wednesdays), unless there is a major virus outbreak. To determine whether definitions for this threat are available by LiveUpdate, refer to the Virus Definitions (LiveUpdate).\nDownloading the definitions using the Intelligent Updater: The Intelligent Updater virus definitions are posted on U.S. business days (Monday through Friday). You should download the definitions from the Symantec Security Response Web site and manually install them. To determine whether definitions for this threat are available by the Intelligent Updater, refer to the Virus Definitions (Intelligent Updater).\n\nThe Intelligent Updater virus definitions are available: Read \"How to update virus definition files using the Intelligent Updater\" for detailed instructions.\n\n4. To scan for and repair the infected files\nStart your Symantec antivirus software and make sure that it is configured to scan all files.\nFor Norton AntiVirus consumer products: Read the document, \"How to configure Norton AntiVirus to scan all files.\"\nFor Symantec AntiVirus Enterprise products: Read the document, \"How to verify that a Symantec corporate antivirus product is set to scan all files.\"\nRun a full system scan.\nIf any files are detected as infected with W32.HLLP.Shodi.B, click Repair.\nIf any files are detected as Backdoor.Trojan or Remacc.Radmin, click Delete.\n\n\n5. To delete the values from the registry\n\nWARNING: Symantec strongly recommends that you back up the registry before making any changes to it. Incorrect changes to the registry can result in permanent data loss or corrupted files. Modify the specified keys only. Read the document, \"How to make a backup of the Windows registry,\" for instructions.\n"
