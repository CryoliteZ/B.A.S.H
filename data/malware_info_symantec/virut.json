Some variants also infect ASP, HTML and PHP files. The virus has worm-like behavior and spreads by copying itself to fixed, removable and network drives. It also opens a back door on the compromised computer.\n\nInfection\nW32.Virut is an entry-point obscuring (EPO) polymorphic file-infecting virus. The virus infects executable files with .exe and .scr extensions by hooking system APIs and as such whenever a file is accessed it may be infected. Executable files that have been infected by W32.Virut may be damaged and therefore may not execute correctly.\n\nCertain variants of W32.Virut are in addition capable of infecting ASP, HTML and PHP files. The virus inserts a malicious HTML IFRAME tag into the files, which causes a copy of the virus to be downloaded and executed when the pages are displayed in a vulnerable Web browser.\n\nW32.Virut also has worm-like characteristics in that it attempts to spread by copying itself to fixed, removable and network drives. The virus also copies an autorun.inf file that causes the virus to be executed whenever the drives are accessed on computers that have AutoPlay enabled.\n\nThe virus may also spread when infected files are distributed via file-sharing networks.\n\nFunctionality\nW32.Virut opens a back door that allows a remote attacker to perform operations on the compromised computer. The back door operates by way of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) with communication encrypted both ways. The back door allows the remote attacker to address compromised computers individually or as a group.\n\nThe back door functionality allows additional files to be downloaded and executed on the compromised computer, which means that the threat is infinitely flexible and extensible; files that have been observed to be downloaded include misleading applications and copies of other malware. It is likely that W32.Virut has been written to provide a channel for the mass installation of pay-per-install software, with the author(s) profiting by way of affiliate programs.\n\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\nSymantec has observed the following geographic distribution of this threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREVELANCE\nSymantec has observed the following following infection levels of this threat worldwide.\n\n\nSYMANTEC PROTECTION SUMMARY\nThe following content is provided by Symantec to protect against this threat family.\n\nAntivirus signatures\nW32.Virut.A\nW32.Virut.B\nW32.Virut.CF\nW32.Virut.H\nW32.Virut.J\nW32.Virut.R\nW32.Virut.U\nW32.Virut.W\n\nAntivirus (heuristic/generic)\nW32.Virut!dam\nW32.Virut!dr\nW32.Virut!html\n\nBrowser protection\nSymantec Browser Protection is known to be effective at preventing some infection attempts made through the Web browser.\n\nIntrusion Prevention System\nHTTP Adobe Flash SWF Plugin Code Exec\nHTTP Adobe JBIG2Decode BO\nHTTP Adobe SWF Malicious Download Attempt\nHTTP Adobe SWF Remote Code Exec\nHTTP DirectAnimation KeyFrame Heap BO\nHTTP MS IE msdds.dll Code Exec\nHTTP MSIE Malformed XML BO\nHTTP NCTAudioFile2 ActiveX BO\nHTTP Snapshot Viewer ActiveX Download Request\nHTTP SnapShot Viewer ActiveX File Download\nHTTP WebViewFolderIcon SetSlice BO\nMSIE Daxctle.OCX KeyFrame Method Heap BO\nMSIE MS Snapshot ActiveX File Download\nMSIE NCTAudioFile2 SetFormatLikeSample ActiveX BO\nMSIE WebViewFolderIcon ActiveX Control BO\nAntivirus Protection Dates\nInitial Rapid Release version April 12, 2007\nLatest Rapid Release version August 8, 2016 revision 023\nInitial Daily Certified version April 12, 2007\nLatest Daily Certified version August 9, 2016 revision 001\nInitial Weekly Certified release date April 18, 2007\n",

Additional information\n\n\n\n1. PREVENTION AND AVOIDANCE\nThe following actions can be taken to avoid or minimize the risk from this threat.\n\n\n1.1 User behavior and precautions\nUsers are advised not to execute files from untrusted sources, such as those downloaded from file-sharing networks. Infected files may be shared without the sharer(s) being aware of their infection. Files that are known to be infected may also be shared by those wishing to increase the levels of infection of the threat, most likely for financial gain. Files such as these may deliberately be given enticing names \u2013 often of otherwise expensive or much sought after programs \u2013 or names with adult themes.\n\n\n1.2 Removable drives\nThe virus copies itself to all fixed and removable drives. Users should disconnect removable drives when not required, and if write access is not needed, enable read-only mode if the option is available. As the virus uses autorun.inf files to execute automatically when drives are accessed, users should ensure that AutoPlay is disabled.\n\n\n1.3 Network drives\nW32.Virut is known to spread through network shares. To reduce the risk of infection, network shares should be opened only when necessary, and file sharing turned off altogether if it is not required. In circumstances where file sharing is essential, permissions should be set to \u2018read-only\u2019 where possible. Users should disable AutoPlay even if removable drives are not in use as autorun.inf files operate on network shares in an identical manner.\n\n\n1.4 Operating system and software patches\nASP, HTML and PHP files that have been infected by capable variants of W32.Virut contain a malicious HTML IFRAME that causes the virus to be downloaded and executed when the pages are viewed on a vulnerable computer. The malicious URL attempts to exploit the following vulnerabilities:\nAdobe Acrobat and Reader PDF File Handling JBIG2 Image Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 33751)\nAdobe Flash Player Multimedia File Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (BID 28695)\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer Daxctle.OCX KeyFrame Method Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (BID 20047)\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer XML Handling Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 32721)\nMicrosoft Visual Studio .NET msdds.dll Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 14594)\nMicrosoft WebViewFolderIcon ActiveX Control Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (BID 19030)\nNCTsoft NCTAudioFile2 ActiveX Control Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (BID 22196)\nSnapshot Viewer for Microsoft Access ActiveX Control Arbitrary File Download Vulnerability (BID 30114)\n\nInstallation of software updates that address these vulnerabilities will reduce the risk of infection.\n\nUsers are also advised to ensure that their operating systems and installed software are fully patched and that antivirus and firewall software is up to date and operational. Users should turn on automatic updates so that their computers can receive the latest patches and updates when they are distributed by software vendors.\n\n\n1.5 Blocking network addresses\nW32.Virut is known to connect to the following network addresses and as such they should be blocked at the firewall or router:\ncore.ircgalaxy.pl (172.24.8.111)\nirc.zief.pl\nproxim.ircgalaxy.pl\nru.brans.pl (218.93.205.30)\n\nNote that some variants attempt to bypass the Windows Firewall.\n\n\n\n2. INFECTION METHOD\nThis threat is known to infect computers by way of a number of methods. Each of these methods is examined in more detail in the following sections.\n\n\n2.1 Infection of .exe and .scr files\nW32.Virut is an entry-point obscuring (EPO) polymorphic file-infecting virus. The virus infects executable files with .exe and .scr extensions by hooking the following NTDLL.DLL API functions:\nZwCreateFile\nZwDeviceIoControlFile\nZwOpenFile\nZwCreateProcess\nZwCreateProcessEx\nZwQueryInformationProcess\n\nThe hooks are used to infect files when they are accessed and to inject the virus into all newly created processes. Some variants also disable Windows System File Protection in order to infect system files.\n\nThe file infection subroutine checks for the following file extensions before attempting to infect a particular file:\n.exe\n.scr\n\nW32.Virut uses an infection marker to prevent multiple infections of the same file. The location of the infection marker varies between variants, however, and for this reason a particular executable may be infected multiple times by different W32.Virut variants.\n\nWhen infecting executables the virus encrypts itself in a polymorphic fashion, adds itself to the file and then either modifies the entry point of the program (to point to itself), or uses the EPO technique of patching the host executable to redirect execution to its own code.\n\nExecutable files that have been infected by W32.Virut may be damaged and therefore may not execute correctly.\n\n\n2.2 Infection of .asp, .htm and .php files\nVariants that are capable of injecting malicious HTML also check for the following extensions when files are accessed:\n.asp\n.htm\n.html\n.php\n\nThe virus injects an IFRAME into files with the above extensions. The IFRAME directs the browser to a malicious URL when the HTML page is viewed either on the compromised computer or after having been served via HTTP.\n\n\n\nW32.Virut variants are known to insert the following malicious URLs into .asp, .htm, .html and .php files:\n[http://]ntkrnlpa.info/r[REMOVED]\n[http://]www.zief.pl/insta[REMOVED]\n[http://]www.zief.pl/rc/ld.[REMOVED]\n[http://]zief.pl/exploit/[EXPLO[REMOVED]\n[http://]zief.pl/insta[REMOVED]\n\nWhen accessed, the malicious URLs attempt to exploit one or more of the following vulnerabilities to download and execute W32.Virut and once more begin the infection cycle:\nAdobe Acrobat and Reader PDF File Handling JBIG2 Image Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 33751)\nAdobe Flash Player Multimedia File Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (BID 28695)\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer Daxctle.OCX KeyFrame Method Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (BID 20047)\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer XML Handling Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 32721)\nMicrosoft Visual Studio .NET msdds.dll Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 14594)\nMicrosoft WebViewFolderIcon ActiveX Control Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (BID 19030)\nNCTsoft NCTAudioFile2 ActiveX Control Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (BID 22196)\nSnapshot Viewer for Microsoft Access ActiveX Control Arbitrary File Download Vulnerability (BID 30114)\n\n\n\n3. FUNCTIONALITY\nW32.Virut opens a back door that allows a remote attacker to download and execute files on the compromised computer. The back door operates over IRC, and non-standard IRC ports \u2013 most notably port 80 \u2013 are used to bypass firewalls and evade detection. The virus's communication with the IRC server component is encrypted using a relatively simple custom algorithm.\n\nBeing based on IRC, the back door functionality enables the remote attacker to address compromised computers either individually or as a group. This functionality allows an attacker to perform targeted attacks on individuals \u2013 for example, stealing specific account passwords or other sensitive information \u2013 as well as carry out distributed denial of service attacks or trigger mass downloads of a particular pay-per-install application, thus generating revenue for the virus authors and/or their customers.\n\n\n3.1 System modifications\nThe following side effects may be observed on computers compromised by members of the W32.Virut threat family:\n\nFiles/folders created\nNone\n\nFiles/folders deleted\nNone\n\nFiles/folders modified\nThe virus infects files with the following extensions:\n.exe\n.scr\n\nSome variants of the virus may infect files with the following extensions:\n.asp\n.htm\n.html\n.php\n\nThe virus may add the following entry to the hosts file:\n127.0.0.1 ZieF.pl\n\nRegistry subkeys/entries created\nThe virus creates the following registry entry to store the IRC server IP address and port number:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\\"UpdateHost\" = \"[BINARY DATA]\"\n\nCertain variants create the following registry entry to bypass the Windows Firewall:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\\"%SystemDrive%\\[PATH TO VIRUS]\\[VIRUS FILE NAME]\" = \"%SystemDrive%\\[PATH TO VIRUS]\\[VIRUS FILE NAME]:*:enabled:@shell32.dll,-1\"\n\nRegistry subkeys/entries deleted\nNone\n\nRegistry subkeys/entries modified\nNone\n\n\n3.2 Network activity\nThe virus checks for an Internet connection every five seconds until an active connection is found. It then attempts to resolve the domain used for the IRC command and control server using two DNS servers, the addresses of which are hard-coded in the virus. If neither of the two DNS servers can be found, the IRC server address cannot be resolved or connection to the IRC server fails, the virus attempts to connect to an alternative server using a backup 'last resort' IP address and port number pair that it has previously stored in the registry.\n\nCommunication with the IRC server is encrypted using a custom stream cipher. A random symmetric encryption key is generated and is used in an XOR operation with each byte, with the key occasionally being deliberately perturbed to reduce the predictability of the ciphertext.\n\nThe virus uses a typical IRC-based communications protocol. Upon connection to the server, the virus sends the following mandatory IRC commands:\n\nNICK [8 RANDOM CHARACTERS]\nUSER [1 RANDOM CHARACTER][OS ID] . . :[%|#][VOL ID][VOL ID CRC] [OS SERVICE PACK]\nJOIN #.[CHANNEL ID]\n\nWhere:\n[OS ID] is a six-byte ID to identify the operating system (OS), with two bytes each used to identify the OS platform, major version and minor version. For example, this field would be sent as 020501 by a copy of the virus running on 32-bit (02) Windows (05) XP (01).\n[%|#] is a one-byte field to indicate the update status of the infection. When the virus first connects to the IRC server, i.e. before a registry host list update has taken place, '%' is used, whereas following any update '#' is used instead.\n[VOL ID] is the eight-byte volume ID of the system disk of the compromised computer.\n[VOL ID CRC] is a one-byte (hexadecimal) hash of the volume ID, (byte1 + byte2 + byte3 + byte4) & 0xF.\n[OS SERVICE PACK] is a string identifying the OS service pack level, for example 'Service Pack 2'\n[CHANNEL ID] is the hard-coded name of the IRC channel to join.\n\nAn example of the above commands is as follows:\n\nNICK tabrpfpu\nUSER g020501 . . :%acc55762b Service Pack 2\nJOIN #.3159\n\nThe virus is able to accept two standard IRC commands from the server. The first command is:\n\nPING [USER]\n\nUpon reception of a PING message, the virus saves the IP address and port number of the current server to the following registry entry:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\\"UpdateHost\" = \"[BINARY DATA]\"\n\nThe virus replies to this message with a PONG message.\n\nThe second standard IRC command that the virus accepts is:\n\nPRIVMSG [USER] [MESSAGE]\n\nThis message is sent by the server to address one or more compromised computers. Two commands are supported in the [MESSAGE] field. The first command causes the virus to download and execute the file at the specified URL:\n\nPRIVMSG [USER] !GET [URL]\n\nThe second command will cause the virus to update its internal list of IRC server hostnames, overriding the hard-coded entries:\n\nPRIVMSG [USER] !HOST [HOST LIST]\n\nOne special case is an empty host list, which causes the back door to close:\n\nPRIVMSG [USER] !HOST\n\n\n\n\n\n4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nFor more information relating to this threat family, please see the following resources:\nBlog entries on W32.Virut\nThe Virut Family Of Viruses (Virut Family FAQ \u2013 February 2009)\nRecommendations\nSymantec Security Response encourages all users and administrators to adhere to the following basic security \"best practices\":\nUse a firewall to block all incoming connections from the Internet to services that should not be publicly available. By default, you should deny all incoming connections and only allow services you explicitly want to offer to the outside world.\nEnforce a password policy. Complex passwords make it difficult to crack password files on compromised computers. This helps to prevent or limit damage when a computer is compromised.\nEnsure that programs and users of the computer use the lowest level of privileges necessary to complete a task. When prompted for a root or UAC password, ensure that the program asking for administration-level access is a legitimate application.\nDisable AutoPlay to prevent the automatic launching of executable files on network and removable drives, and disconnect the drives when not required. If write access is not required, enable read-only mode if the option is available.\nTurn off file sharing if not needed. If file sharing is required, use ACLs and password protection to limit access. Disable anonymous access to shared folders. Grant access only to user accounts with strong passwords to folders that must be shared.\nTurn off and remove unnecessary services. By default, many operating systems install auxiliary services that are not critical. These services are avenues of attack. If they are removed, threats have less avenues of attack.\nIf a threat exploits one or more network services, disable, or block access to, those services until a patch is applied.\nAlways keep your patch levels up-to-date, especially on computers that host public services and are accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services.\nConfigure your email server to block or remove email that contains file attachments that are commonly used to spread threats, such as .vbs, .bat, .exe, .pif and .scr files.\nIsolate compromised computers quickly to prevent threats from spreading further. Perform a forensic analysis and restore the computers using trusted media.\nTrain employees not to open attachments unless they are expecting them. Also, do not execute software that is downloaded from the Internet unless it has been scanned for viruses. Simply visiting a compromised Web site can cause infection if certain browser vulnerabilities are not patched.\nIf Bluetooth is not required for mobile devices, it should be turned off. If you require its use, ensure that the device's visibility is set to \"Hidden\" so that it cannot be scanned by other Bluetooth devices. If device pairing must be used, ensure that all devices are set to \"Unauthorized\", requiring authorization for each connection request. Do not accept applications that are unsigned or sent from unknown sources.\nFor further information on the terms used in this document, please refer to the Security Response glossary.\n",

By default, you should deny all incoming connections and only allow services you explicitly want to offer to the outside world.\nEnforce a password policy. Complex passwords make it difficult to crack password files on compromised computers. This helps to prevent or limit damage when a computer is compromised.\nEnsure that programs and users of the computer use the lowest level of privileges necessary to complete a task. When prompted for a root or UAC password, ensure that the program asking for administration-level access is a legitimate application.\nDisable AutoPlay to prevent the automatic launching of executable files on network and removable drives, and disconnect the drives when not required. If write access is not required, enable read-only mode if the option is available.\nTurn off file sharing if not needed. If file sharing is required, use ACLs and password protection to limit access. Disable anonymous access to shared folders. Grant access only to user accounts with strong passwords to folders that must be shared.\nTurn off and remove unnecessary services. By default, many operating systems install auxiliary services that are not critical. These services are avenues of attack. If they are removed, threats have less avenues of attack.\nIf a threat exploits one or more network services, disable, or block access to, those services until a patch is applied.\nAlways keep your patch levels up-to-date, especially on computers that host public services and are accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services.\nConfigure your email server to block or remove email that contains file attachments that are commonly used to spread threats, such as .vbs, .bat, .exe, .pif and .scr files.\nIsolate compromised computers quickly to prevent threats from spreading further. Perform a forensic analysis and restore the computers using trusted media.\nTrain employees not to open attachments unless they are expecting them. Also, do not execute software that is downloaded from the Internet unless it has been scanned for viruses. Simply visiting a compromised Web site can cause infection if certain browser vulnerabilities are not patched.\nIf Bluetooth is not required for mobile devices, it should be turned off. If you require its use, ensure that the device's visibility is set to \"Hidden\" so that it cannot be scanned by other Bluetooth devices. If device pairing must be used, ensure that all devices are set to \"Unauthorized\", requiring authorization for each connection request.

Disable or password-protect file-sharing, or set the shared files to Read-Only, before reconnecting the computers to the network or to the Internet. Because this worm spreads by using shared folders on networked computers, to ensure that the worm does not reinfect the computer after it has been removed, Symantec suggests sharing with Read-Only access or by using password protection.\n\nFor instructions on how to do this, refer to your Windows documentation, or the document: How to configure shared Windows folders for maximum network protection.\n\nIf you are removing an infection from a network, first make sure that all of the shares are disabled or set to Read-Only.\n\nThis tool is not designed to run on Novell NetWare servers. To remove this threat from a NetWare server, first make sure that you have the current virus definitions, and then run a full system scan with the Symantec antivirus product.\n\nHow to download and run the tool\n\nImportant: You must have administrative rights to run this tool on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7.\n\nNote for administrators: If you are running MS Exchange 2000 Server, we recommend that you exclude the M drive from the scan by running the tool from a command line with the Exclude switch. For more information, read the Microsoft knowledge base article: XADM: Do Not Back Up or Scan Exchange 2000 Drive M (Article 298924).\n\nFollow these steps to download and run the tool:\nDownload the FixVirut.exe file from the following location:\nFixVirut.CF Removal Tool\nThe FixVirut.exe file is a self-extracting archive file that contains FixVirut32bit.com and FixVirut64bit.com. Double-click the FixVirut.exe file to extract these files on to your computer.\nOptional: To check the authenticity of the digital signature of the FixVirut32bit.com or FixVirut64bit.com files, refer to the \"Digital signature\" section later in this writeup.\n\nNote: If you are sure that you are downloading this tool from the Security Response Web site, you can skip this step. If you are not sure, or are a network administrator and need to authenticate the files before deployment, follow the steps in the \"Digital signature\" section before proceeding with step 4.\n\nClose all the running programs.\nIf you are on a network or if you have a full-time connection to the Internet, disconnect the computer from the network and the Internet.\nIf you are running Windows Me, XP, Vista or 7, turn off System Restore. For instructions on how to turn off System Restore, read your Windows documentation, or one of the following articles:\n\nHow to disable or enable Windows Me System Restore\nHow to turn off or turn on Windows XP System Restore\n\nTurn System Restore on or off (Applies to Windows 7)\nDouble-click the appropriate version (FixVirut32bit.com or FixVirut64bit.com) for your operating system to start the removal tool.\n",

By default, many operating systems install auxiliary services that are not critical. These services are avenues of attack. If they are removed, threats have less avenues of attack.\nIf a threat exploits one or more network services, disable, or block access to, those services until a patch is applied.\nAlways keep your patch levels up-to-date, especially on computers that host public services and are accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services.\nConfigure your email server to block or remove email that contains file attachments that are commonly used to spread threats, such as .vbs, .bat, .exe, .pif and .scr files.\nIsolate compromised computers quickly to prevent threats from spreading further. Perform a forensic analysis and restore the computers using trusted media.\nTrain employees not to open attachments unless they are expecting them. Also, do not execute software that is downloaded from the Internet unless it has been scanned for viruses. Simply visiting a compromised Web site can cause infection if certain browser vulnerabilities are not patched.\nIf Bluetooth is not required for mobile devices, it should be turned off. If you require its use, ensure that the device's visibility is set to \"Hidden\" so that it cannot be scanned by other Bluetooth devices. If device pairing must be used, ensure that all devices are set to \"Unauthorized\", requiring authorization for each connection request. Do not accept applications that are unsigned or sent from unknown sources.\nFor further information on the terms used in this document, please refer to the Security Response glossary.\n"
