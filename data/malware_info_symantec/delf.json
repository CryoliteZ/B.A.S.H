Perform a forensic analysis and restore the computers using trusted media.\nTrain employees not to open attachments unless they are expecting them. Also, do not execute software that is downloaded from the Internet unless it has been scanned for viruses. Simply visiting a compromised Web site can cause infection if certain browser vulnerabilities are not patched.\nIf Bluetooth is not required for mobile devices, it should be turned off.

When Backdoor.Delf.D runs, it performs the following actions:\n\nIt displays the message\n\nsetup failed\n\nand then copies itself as %windir%\\Xdaemon.exe.\n\nNOTE: %windir% is a variable. The Trojan locates the Windows main installation folder (by default this is C:\\Windows or C:\\Winnt) and uses it as a destination folder.\n\nThe Trojan creates the value\n\nmicrosoft xdaemon 2.0 %windir%\\xdaemon.exe -disable\n\nin the registry key\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nso that the Trojan starts when you start or restart Windows.\n\nThe Trojan installs hook procedures into a hook chain to monitor the system for any keyboard and mouse input. The keyboard and mouse hook procedures process the keystrokes or mouse actions and pass the hook information to the next hook procedure in the current hook chain. This permits Backdoor.Delf.D to intercept any key strokes.\n\nThe Trojan notifies the client side using ICQ pager.\n\nOnce installed, Backdoor.Delf.D waits for commands from the remote client. The commands allow the hacker to perform any of the following actions:\nDeliver system and network information to the hacker, including login names and cached network passwords.\nInventory the files that are stored on the compromised computer.\nCreate a screenshot in the form of a JPEG file and transmit the captured screen image to the hacker.\n\n\nRecommendations\nSymantec Security Response encourages all users and administrators to adhere to the following basic security \"best practices\":\nUse a firewall to block all incoming connections from the Internet to services that should not be publicly available. By default, you should deny all incoming connections and only allow services you explicitly want to offer to the outside world.\nEnforce a password policy. Complex passwords make it difficult to crack password files on compromised computers. This helps to prevent or limit damage when a computer is compromised.\nEnsure that programs and users of the computer use the lowest level of privileges necessary to complete a task. When prompted for a root or UAC password, ensure that the program asking for administration-level access is a legitimate application.\nDisable AutoPlay to prevent the automatic launching of executable files on network and removable drives, and disconnect the drives when not required. If write access is not required, enable read-only mode if the option is available.\nTurn off file sharing if not needed. If file sharing is required, use ACLs and password protection to limit access. Disable anonymous access to shared folders. Grant access only to user accounts with strong passwords to folders that must be shared.\nTurn off and remove unnecessary services. By default, many operating systems install auxiliary services that are not critical. These services are avenues of attack.
