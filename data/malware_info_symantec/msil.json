By default, you should deny all incoming connections and only allow services you explicitly want to offer to the outside world.\nEnforce a password policy. Complex passwords make it difficult to crack password files on compromised computers. This helps to prevent or limit damage when a computer is compromised.\nEnsure that programs and users of the computer use the lowest level of privileges necessary to complete a task. When prompted for a root or UAC password, ensure that the program asking for administration-level access is a legitimate application.\nDisable AutoPlay to prevent the automatic launching of executable files on network and removable drives, and disconnect the drives when not required. If write access is not required, enable read-only mode if the option is available.\nTurn off file sharing if not needed. If file sharing is required, use ACLs and password protection to limit access. Disable anonymous access to shared folders. Grant access only to user accounts with strong passwords to folders that must be shared.\nTurn off and remove unnecessary services. By default, many operating systems install auxiliary services that are not critical. These services are avenues of attack. If they are removed, threats have less avenues of attack.\nIf a threat exploits one or more network services, disable, or block access to, those services until a patch is applied.\nAlways keep your patch levels up-to-date, especially on computers that host public services and are accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services.\nConfigure your email server to block or remove email that contains file attachments that are commonly used to spread threats, such as .vbs, .bat, .exe, .pif and .scr files.\nIsolate compromised computers quickly to prevent threats from spreading further. Perform a forensic analysis and restore the computers using trusted media.\nTrain employees not to open attachments unless they are expecting them. Also, do not execute software that is downloaded from the Internet unless it has been scanned for viruses. Simply visiting a compromised Web site can cause infection if certain browser vulnerabilities are not patched.\nIf Bluetooth is not required for mobile devices, it should be turned off. If you require its use, ensure that the device's visibility is set to \"Hidden\" so that it cannot be scanned by other Bluetooth devices. If device pairing must be used, ensure that all devices are set to \"Unauthorized\", requiring authorization for each connection request. Do not accept applications that are unsigned or sent from unknown sources.\nFor further information on the terms used in this document, please refer to the Security Response glossary.\n",

            "symptoms": "Discovered:\nSeptember 26, 2007\nUpdated:\nSeptember 27, 2007 12:03:32 AM\nType:\nWorm\nInfection Length:\n10,752 bytes\nSystems Affected:\nLinux, Mac, Solaris, Windows\nFor Windows:\nThe following instructions pertain to all current and recent Symantec antivirus products, including the Symantec AntiVirus and Norton AntiVirus product lines.\nDisable System Restore (Windows Me/XP).\nUpdate the virus definitions.\nRun a full system scan.\n\nFor specific details on each of these steps, read the following instructions.\n\n1. To disable System Restore (Windows Me/XP)\nIf you are running Windows Me or Windows XP, we recommend that you temporarily turn off System Restore. Windows Me/XP uses this feature, which is enabled by default, to restore the files on your computer in case they become damaged. If a virus, worm, or Trojan infects a computer, System Restore may back up the virus, worm, or Trojan on the computer.\n\nWindows prevents outside programs, including antivirus programs, from modifying System Restore. Therefore, antivirus programs or tools cannot remove threats in the System Restore folder. As a result, System Restore has the potential of restoring an infected file on your computer, even after you have cleaned the infected files from all the other locations.\n\nAlso, a virus scan may detect a threat in the System Restore folder even though you have removed the threat.\n\nFor instructions on how to turn off System Restore, read your Windows documentation, or one of the following articles:\nHow to disable or enable Windows Me System Restore\nHow to turn off or turn on Windows XP System Restore\n\nNote: When you are completely finished with the removal procedure and are satisfied that the threat has been removed, reenable System Restore by following the instructions in the aforementioned documents.\n\nFor additional information, and an alternative to disabling Windows Me System Restore, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article: Antivirus Tools Cannot Clean Infected Files in the _Restore Folder (Article ID: Q263455).\n\n2. To update the virus definitions\nSymantec Security Response fully tests all the virus definitions for quality assurance before they are posted to our servers. There are two ways to obtain the most recent virus definitions:\nRunning LiveUpdate, which is the easiest way to obtain virus definitions.\nIf you use Norton AntiVirus 2006, Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition 10.0, or newer products, LiveUpdate definitions are updated daily. These products include newer technology.\n\nIf you use Norton AntiVirus 2005, Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition 9.0, or earlier products, LiveUpdate definitions are updated weekly. The exception is major outbreaks, when definitions are updated more often.\nDownloading the definitions using the Intelligent Updater: The Intelligent Updater virus definitions are posted daily. You should download the definitions from the Symantec Security Response Web site and manually install them.\n\nThe latest Intelligent Updater virus definitions can be obtained here: Intelligent Updater virus definitions. For detailed instructions read the document: How to update virus definition files using the Intelligent Updater.\n\n3. To run a full system scan\nStart your Symantec antivirus program and make sure that it is configured to scan all the files.\nFor Norton AntiVirus consumer products: Read the document: How to configure Norton AntiVirus to scan all files.\n\nFor Symantec AntiVirus Enterprise products: Read the document: How to verify that a Symantec Corporate antivirus product is set to scan all files.\nRun a full system scan.\nIf any files are detected, follow the instructions displayed by your antivirus program.\nImportant: If you are unable to start your Symantec antivirus product or the product reports that it cannot delete a detected file, you may need to stop the risk from running in order to remove it. To do this, run the scan in Safe mode. For instructions, read the document, How to start the computer in Safe Mode. Once you have restarted in Safe mode, run the scan again.\n\n\nAfter the files are deleted, restart the computer in Normal mode.\n\n\nFor Linux and Solaris:\nIf your Symantec antivirus product detects this threat, delete the files in question.\n\nOnce the threat attacks a computer, it is difficult to determine what else the computer has been exposed to. In most cases, changes other than those made by the threat will not have occurred. However, the author of the threat may have been able to use the threat to access the computer to make changes to it. Unless you can be absolutely sure that malicious activity has not been performed on the computer, we recommend completely reinstalling the operating system.\n\n"
