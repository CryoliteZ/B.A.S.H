Scans for .HTM and .HTML files on all local hard disks and infects them by prepending a reference to worm’s CLSID             there. It also performs a DoS attack on three websites located in Estonia",

After getting control, the worm creates a few threads. <ul> 1. One thread scans for vulnerable computers (on TCP ports 139 and 445) and sends exploits there in order to infect them. <br> (1)Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-040，利用Server 服務中的弱點可能會允許遠端執行程式碼 <br> (2)字典破解弱密碼 </ul> <ul> 2.
