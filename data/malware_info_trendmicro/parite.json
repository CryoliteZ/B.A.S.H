It then continues its infection routine in its accessed shares.It may also arrive as an email file (EML) file that contains the malware executable in Base-64 format. In this form, this file infector executes when the malicious EML file is opened. Once opened, it searches for .HTM or .HTML files on the infected system with the strings \"README\" in their file names. Once found, it drops a copy of the .EML file into the folder where the infected .HTML file is found. The infected HTML file is detected by Trend Micro as JS_NIMDA.A. Adds a script line to the infected HTML file to execute the embedded malicious .EML file when the infected HTML file is opened and viewed. This action guarantees continuous infection and increases security risk of the infected system. NOTES: ",
