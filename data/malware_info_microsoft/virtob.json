            "summary": "Windows Defender <br> detects and removes this threat. <br> This threat can give a malicious hacker access and control of your PC to download and run files. <br> See theWin32/Virut family description for more information. <br>  <br> ",
            "tech": "Threat behavior  <br> Installation <br> Virus:Win32/Virut.BN might be downloaded and installed by other malware. <br> Spreads via <br> File infection <br> The virusdisables Windows System File Protection (SFP) by injecting code into the Windows process \"winlogon.exe\". The injected code modifies the system file \"sfc_os.dll\" in memory which in turn allows the virus to infect files protected by SFP. <br> Virus:Win32/Virut.BN infects .EXE and.SCR files, hence actions such as copying or viewing files with Explorer, includingon shares (with write access) will result in files being infected, and the virus spreading from PC to PC. <br> The virus injects its own code into a system process such as \"explorer.exe\" or\"winlogon.exe\", and hooks low-level (NTDLL layer) Windows API calls in order to stay in memory. It hooks the following functions in each running process (NTDLL.DLL): <br> NtCreateFile <br> NtOpenFile <br> NtCreateProcess <br> NtCreateProcessEx <br> Thus, every time an infected process runs, so does the virus. <br> It also writes code to HTML files that adds a hidden IFrame pointing to the domain \"zief.pl\". When you open an HTML file, the browser connects to this server without you knowing. The HTML page hosted at this location attempts to exploit a number of different vulnerabilities (browser-based and program-specific vulnerabilities) in order to run a copy of the virus. These modified HTML files aredetected as Virus:HTML/Virut.BH. <br> The virus also modifies the local machine's Hosts file, redirecting the domain \"zief.pl\" to local host (127.0.0.1) so thatalready-infected PCs will notrun the remotely-hosted copy of the virus. <br> Payload <br> Allows backdoor access and control <br> Virut.BNtries to connect toInternet Relay Channel (IRC) server \"irc.zief.pl\"through port 80 using a particular channel. Should this fail, it instead attempts to connect to \"proxim.ircgalaxy.pl\" also using port 80. <br> It contains functionality to download and run files on your PC. This may include additional malware. The backdoor can also be used to change the host that it connects to for control. <br> Analysis by Dan Kurc <br> Prevention  <br> Take these steps to help prevent infection on your PC. <br>  <br> ",
