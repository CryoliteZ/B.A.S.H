It is important to install updates for all the software that is installed in your computer. These are usually available from vendor Web sites. <br> You can use the Automatic Updates feature in Windows to automatically download future Microsoft security updates while your computer is on and connected to the Internet.  <br> How to turn on Automatic Updates in Windows 7 <br> How to turn on Automatic Updates in Windows Vista <br> How to turn on Automatic Updates in Windows XP <br> Use up-to-date antivirus software  <br> Most antivirus software can detect and prevent infection by known malicious software. To help protect you from infection, you should always run antivirus software, such as Microsoft Security Essentials,that is updated with the latest signature files. For more information, see http://www.microsoft.com/security/antivirus/av.aspx. <br> Limit user privileges on the computer <br> Starting with Windows Vista and Windows 7, Microsoft introduced User Account Control (UAC), which, when enabled, allowed users to run with least user privileges. This scenario limits the possibility of attacks bymalware and other threats that require administrative privileges to run. <br> You can configure UAC in your computer to meet your preferences: <br> User Account Control in Windows 7 <br> User Account Control in Windows Vista <br> Applying the Principle of Least Privilege in Windows XP <br> More on User Account Control <br> Use caution when opening attachments and accepting file transfers <br> Exercise caution with e-mail and attachmentsreceived from unknown sources, or received unexpectedly from known sources. Use extreme caution when accepting file transfers from known or unknown sources. <br> Use caution when clicking on links to Web pages <br> Exercise caution with links toWeb pages that you receive from unknown sources, especially if the links are to a Web page that you are not familiar with,unsure of the destination of, or suspicious of. Malicious software may be installed in yourcomputer simply by visiting aWeb page with harmful content. <br> Avoid downloading pirated software <br> Threats may also be bundled with software and files that are available for download on various torrent sites. Downloading \"cracked\" or \"pirated\" software from these sites carries not only the risk of being infected with malware, but is also illegal. For more information, see 'The risks of obtaining and using pirated software'. <br> Protect yourself from social engineering attacks <br> While attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware or software to compromise a computer, they also attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in human behavior to do the same. When an attacker attempts to take advantage of human behavior to persuade the affected user to perform an action of the attacker's choice, it is known as 'social engineering'. Essentially, social engineering is an attack against the human interface of the targeted computer. For more information, see 'What is social engineering?'. <br> Use strong passwords <br> Attackers may try to gain access to your Windows account by guessing your password. It is therefore important that you use a strong password  one that cannot be easily guessed by an attacker. A strong password is one that has at least 8 characters, and combines letters, numbers, and symbols.
